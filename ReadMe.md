# Ready

This is my first Full Stack Project. I have been only focusing on the front-end side
of things, because I enjoy that more, but it is time to move on. Yeah so we need a lot
of tools in order to make this work: NextJS Typescript GraphQL URQL Node.js PostgreSQL
TypeORM Redis TypegraphQL. At the end we will have something like a Reddit Clone.
